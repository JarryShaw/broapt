We hereby describe BroAPT system, an APT detection system based on Bro IDS. The system monitors APT based on comprehensive analysis of the network traffic. It is granted with high performance and extensibility. It can reassemble then extract files transmitted in the traffic, analyse and generate log files in real-time; it can also classify extracted files through targeted malicious file detection configuration; and it detects APT attacks based on analysis of the log files generated by the system itself.
