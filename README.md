Cybersecurity has long been a significant subject under discussion. With rapid evolution of new cyber attack methods, the threat of Internet is becoming more and more intense. Advanced persistent threat (APT) has become a main source of cybersecurity events. It is now even more important to identify and classify network traffic by direct analysis on the traffic itself in an accurate and timely manner.

We hereby describe BroAPT system, an APT detection system based on Bro IDS. The system monitors APT based on comprehensive analysis of the network traffic. It is granted with high performance and extensibility. It can reassemble then extract files transmitted in the traffic, analyse and generate log files in real-time; it can also classify extracted files through targeted malicious file detection configuration; and it detects APT attacks based on analysis of the log files generated by the system itself.

Although our research on APT detection is quite preceding, the BroAPT system utilised Bro IDS and works as an APT detection system which is compatible with high-speed network traffic. The system has been proved in practical scenarios and is the basis of follow-up researches on APT detection.

## Synopsis

- `make commit`: commit current workplace
- `make pipenv`: update pipenv on root directory
- `make download`: update then download Python dependency files into `vendor/python/download`
- `make submodule`: clone all submodules into `vendor`
