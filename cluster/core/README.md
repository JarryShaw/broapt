# BroAPT Core - Extraction Framework

This work is the extraction framework of BroAPT, which based on
[File Analysis](https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/frameworks/file-analysis.html) framework of the
infamous [Zeek](zeek/zeek) Network Security Monitor, with a proper Python wrapper to fulfil the
indended design.

## Prerequisites

- Bro/Zeek, version 2.6.1
  > __NOTE__: on Ubuntu 16.04, no binary distribution of version 2.6.1 is available
  * for macOS, run `brew install bro`
  * for binary distribution, see [this page](https://www.zeek.org/download/packages.html)
  * some binary distributions can also be found in `/vendor/archive/` folder
  * if wish to build from source, a sample script can be found in `/docker/` folder
  * in `/vendor/Makefile`, you may also find how to build from source on macOS with a
    Pipenv virtual environment
- Python, version 3.6+ (tested only on 3.6.7 and 3.7.3)
  > __NOTE__: requirements are provided in `./vendor/python/` folder
  * [`dataclasses`](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses)
  * [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org)
  * [`python-magic`](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic)

For Docker addict, a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` are both provided, just hit and go.
For development environment, `make` and `pipenv` are the two things playing around my workflow.

## Environment

- `BROAPT_FORCE_UPDATE` -- force update MIME mapping (*default*: `false`)

- `BROAPT_CORE_CPU` -- concurrent process limit (*default*: 5)
- `BROAPT_CORE_INTERVAL` -- sleep interval (*default*: 10s)

- `BROAPT_LOAD_MIME` -- Bro MIME while list (*default*: all MIME types)
- `BROAPT_LOAD_PROTOCOL` -- Bro protocol while list (*default*: null)

- `BROAPT_MIME_MODE` -- store extracted files by MIME types (*default*: `true`)
- `BROAPT_JSON_LOGS` -- log in JSON format (*default*: `true`)

- `BROAPT_HASH_MD5` -- calculate MD5 value of extracted files (*default*: `false`)
- `BROAPT_HASH_SHA1` -- calculate SHA1 value of extracted files (*default*: `false`)
- `BROAPT_HASH_SHA256` -- calculate SHA256 value of extracted files (*default*: `false`)

- `BROAPT_X509_MODE` -- include X509 information (*default*: `false`)
- `BROAPT_ENTROPY_MODE` -- include entropy information (*default*: `false`)

- `BROAPT_BARE_MODE` -- run Bro in bare mode (*default*: `false`)
- `BROAPT_NO_CHKSUM` -- run Bro with `-C` option (*default*: `true`)

- `BROAPT_DUMP_PATH` -- where extracted files will be stored (*default*: `FileExtract::prefix`)
- `BROAPT_PCAP_PATH` -- path to PCAP source files (*default*: `/pcap/`)
- `BROAPT_LOGS_PATH` -- path to log files (*default*: `/var/log/bro/`)

- `BROAPT_FILE_BUFFER` -- Bro file reassembly buffer size (*default*: `Files::reassembly_buffer_size`)
- `BROAPT_SIZE_LIMIT` -- Bro extracted file size limit (*default*: `FileExtract::default_limit`)

- `BROAPT_HOOK_CPU` -- concurrent hook processes (*default*: 1)

## Usage

### Main functions

```shell
$ cd ./source/
$ python3 ./python/ [<path-to-pcap> ...]
```

This will extract files transferred in the network traffic, as stored in the PCAP sources.
The naming convention for the extracted files is: `${PROTOCOL}-${FILE_UID}.${FILE_EXT}`.

In default, all files are extracted to `${DUMP_PATH}` and saved with identification of its
MIME type.

- if `${DUMP_MIME}` sets to `true`, files will be classified in folders named after its MIME
  type, i.e. `${CONTENT_TYPE}/${SUBTYPE}/${PROTOCOL}-${FILE_UID}.${FILE_EXT}`
- otherwise, files will be named as `${PROTOCOL}-${FILE_UID}.${CONTENT_TYPE}.${SUBTYPE}.${FILE_EXT}`

For now, known supported protocols are: DTLS, FTP, HTTP, IRC and SMTP.

### External hooks

BroAPT-Core supports external hooks also.

As samples provided in `./include/`, there are two types of hooks for the framework.

#### Bro scripts

External Bro scripts (`./include/scripts/`) will be mapped as `/source/scripts/sites/`. In
the core configuration script (`./source/scripts/config.bro`), these scripts will be loaded by
`@load ./sites`.

The example scripts here are to add two columns to `http.log` generated by Bro.

- `cookies`: `COOKIE` mime field in HTTP headers
- `headers`: raw (not exactly original, but sorted as original) HTTP headers

#### Python functions

External Python functions (`./include/python/`) will be mapped as `/source/python/sites/`. In
the remote daemon function (`./source/python/remote.py`). These functions should be registered
to `HOOK` (`list` type) defined in `./source/python/const.py`. These functions will be called
through the exposed API `hook` as defined in `./include/python/__init__.py`. The function
`hook` takes one argument `log_name`, which is *stem of log path to be analysed externally*.

The example functions here are to generate a new HTTP log (`${BROAPT_LOGS_PATH}/http.log` in JSON
format) with following fields:

- `scrip` -- internal source IP address
- `ad` -- device number (always `null`)
- `ts` -- timestamp (in microseconds)
- `url` -- URL of current request
- `ref` -- referer of current request (base64 encoded)
- `ua` -- user agent of current request (base64 encoded)
- `dstip` -- HTTP server IP address
- `cookie` -- COOKIE of current request (base64 encoded)
- `src_port` -- internal source port
- `json` -- HTTP headers
